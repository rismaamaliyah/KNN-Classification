# KNN-Classification

This project is one of the introductory courses in artificial intelligence. This project is an implementation of a binary classification model using the KNN (K-nearest Neighbors) method which functions to classify data based on a train data set, which is taken from its k nearest neighbors. Where k is the number of nearest neighbors.
